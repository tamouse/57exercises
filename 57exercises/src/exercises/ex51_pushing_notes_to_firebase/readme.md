“Some external services allow you to update data, not just read it. Firebase[5] is a service that lets you create your own database so you can save data for web, mobile, and desktop applications. And you can use it with any programming language, thanks to its JSON-based API.

Create a simple command-line application that lets you save and show notes, using Firebase to save the notes. The application should support the following commands:

mynotes new Learn how to invert binary trees should save the note.

Use mynotes show to display all of the existing notes.”

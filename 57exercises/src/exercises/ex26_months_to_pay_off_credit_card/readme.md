“Write a program that will help you determine how many months it will take to pay off a credit card balance. The program should ask the user to enter the balance of a credit card and the APR of the card. The program should then return the number of months needed.

The formula for this is

n = -1/30 * log(1 + (b/p * (1 - (1 + i)^30))) / log(1 + i)

where

n is the number of months.

i is the daily rate (APR divided by 365).

b is the balance.

p is the monthly payment.”

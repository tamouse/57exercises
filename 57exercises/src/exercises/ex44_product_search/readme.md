“Pulling data from a file into a complex data structure makes parsing much simpler. Many programming languages support the JSON format, a popular way of representing data.

Create a program that takes a product name as input and retrieves the current price and quantity for that product. The product data is in a data file in the JSON format and looks like this:

​ 	
{
​ 	
  "products" : [
​ 	
    {"name": "Widget", "price": 25.00, "quantity": 5 },
​ 	
    {"name": "Thing", "price": 15.00, "quantity": 5 },
​ 	
    {"name": "Doodad", "price": 5.00, "quantity": 10 }
​ 	
  ]
​ 	
}
Print out the product name, price, and quantity if the product is found. If no product matches the search, state that no product was found and start over.”

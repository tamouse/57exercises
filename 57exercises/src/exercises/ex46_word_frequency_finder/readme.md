“Knowing how often a word appears in a sentence or block of text is helpful for creating word clouds and other types of word analysis. And it’s more useful when running it against lots of text.

Create a program that reads in a file and counts the frequency of words in the file. Then construct a histogram displaying the words and the frequency, and display the histogram to the screen.”

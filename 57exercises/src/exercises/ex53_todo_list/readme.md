“Let’s start with the good-old trusty todo list, the “Hello, World” of full programs. You’re going to write a command-line todo list program that meets the following specifications:

Prompt the user to enter a chore or task. Store the task in a permanent location so that the task persists when the program is restarted.

Allow the user to enter as many tasks as desired but stop entering tasks by entering a blank task. Do not store the blank task.

Display all the tasks.

Allow the user to remove a task, to signify it’s been completed.”

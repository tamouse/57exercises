“Write a program that displays information about a given movie. Prompt for a search query and display the title, year, rating, running time, and a synopsis, if one exists. Then, if the audience score is above 80%, recommend that the user watch this movie right now. If the score is below 50%, recommend that the user avoid the movie at all costs.”

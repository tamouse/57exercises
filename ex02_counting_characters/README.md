# Setting up a default task in Mix to run the application!

Create the task in `lib/mix/tasks`, make it into a module named
`Mix.Tasks.My_task` and include `use Mix.Task` in the module.

Create a function `run(_)` to run the task.

See `lib/mix/tasks/counter.ex` and in the `mix.exs` file look at the
`default_task` definition in the `project` method.

Wow!

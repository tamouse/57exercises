“Alphabetizing the contents of a file, or sorting its contents, is a great way to get comfortable manipulating a file in your program.

Create a program that reads in the following list of names:

​ 	
Ling, Mai
​ 	
Johnson, Jim
​ 	
Zarnecki, Sabrina
​ 	
Jones, Chris
​ 	
Jones, Aaron
​ 	
Swift, Geoffrey
​ 	
Xiong, Fong
Read this program and sort the list alphabetically. Then print the sorted list to a file that looks like the following example output.

Example Output
​ 	
Total of 7 names
​ 	
-----------------
​ 	
Ling, Mai
​ 	
Johnson, Jim
​ 	
Jones, Aaron
​ 	
Jones, Chris
​ 	
Swift, Geoffrey
​ 	
Xiong, Fong

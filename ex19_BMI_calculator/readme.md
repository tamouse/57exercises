“Create a program to calculate the body mass index (BMI) for a person using the person’s height in inches and weight in pounds. The program should prompt the user for weight and height.

Calculate the BMI by using the following formula:

bmi = (weight / (height ^ 2)) * 703

If the BMI is between 18.5 and 25, display that the person is at a normal weight. If they are out of that range, tell them if they are underweight or overweight and tell them to consult their doctor.”

“Write a program that prompts for a first name, last name, employee ID, and ZIP code. Ensure that the input is valid according to these rules:

The first name must be filled in.

The last name must be filled in.

The first and last names must be at least two characters long.

An employee ID is in the format AA-1234. So, two letters, a hyphen, and four numbers.

The ZIP code must be a number.

Display appropriate error messages on incorrect data.”

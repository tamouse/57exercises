Create a web application that lets users share a snippet of text, similar to http://pastie.org. The program you write should follow these specifications:

- The user should enter the text into a text area and save the text.
- The text should be stored in a data store.
- The program should generate a URL that can be used to retrieve the saved text.
- When a user follows that URL, the text should be displayed, along with an invitation to edit the text.
- When a user clicks the Edit button, the text should be copied and placed in the same interface used to create new text snippets.

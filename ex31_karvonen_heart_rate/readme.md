When you loop, you can control how much you increment the counter; you don’t always have to increment by one.

When getting into a fitness program, you may want to figure out your target heart rate so you don’t overexert yourself. The Karvonen heart rate formula is one method you can use to determine your rate. Create a program that prompts for your age and your resting heart rate. Use the Karvonen formula to determine the target heart rate based on a range of intensities from 55% to 95%. Generate a table with the results as shown in the example output. The formula is

target heart rate = (((220 - age) - restingHR) * intensity) + restingHR

Example Output


Resting Pulse: 65    Age: 22


|Intensity    | Rate|
|-------------|--------|
|55%          | 138 bpm|
|60%          | 145 bpm|
|65%          | 151 bpm|
| :           |   :       (extra lines omitted)|
|85%          | 178 bpm|
|90%          | 185 bpm|
|95%          | 191 bpm|

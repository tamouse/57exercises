Create a program that computes simple interest. Prompt for the principal amount, the rate as a percentage, 
and the time, and display the amount accrued (principal + interest).

The formula for simple interest is 

    A = P * (1 + r*t)

where:
 
- `P` is the principal amount, 
- `r` is the annual rate of interest, 
- `t` is the number of years the amount is invested, and 
- `A` is the amount at the end of the investment.

“Sometimes data comes in as a structured format that you have to break down and turn into records so you can process them. CSV, or comma-separated values, is a common standard for doing this.

Construct a program that reads in the following data file:

​ 	
Ling,Mai,55900
​ 	
Johnson,Jim,56500
​ 	
Jones,Aaron,46000
​ 	
Jones,Chris,34500
​ 	
Swift,Geoffrey,14200
​ 	
Xiong,Fong,65000
​ 	
Zarnecki,Sabrina,51500
Process the records and display the results formatted as a table, evenly spaced, as shown in the example output.

Example Output
​ 	
Last     First     Salary

​ 	
Jones    Chris     34500
​ 	
Swift    Geoffrey  14200
​ 	
Xiong    Fong      65000

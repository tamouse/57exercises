Working through Brian Hogan's _Exercises for Programmers: 57
Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills_

Branches are for working in a different language, for example, the
`python3` branch for working with Python 3.x.

# React

For the React branch, I'm creating a react app in `./57exercises/` and
shifting all the exercises into components. The main app will be
pretty much just a big router as I work through the exercises.

Whee!!
